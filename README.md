# TrendBoi MT4

TrendBoi MT4 is an expert advisor for MetaTrader 4 developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to optimize DAX trading on a daily basis. This code provides a basic framework for the expert advisor and includes functions for initialization, deinitialization, and trading operations.

## How it Works

### Global Variables

The expert advisor includes several global variables that can be adjusted to customize its behavior:

- `LotSize` - The initial lot size for trading.
- `Slippage` - The slippage value in pips.
- `StopLoss` - The stop loss value in pips.
- `TakeProfit` - The take profit value in pips.

### Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is called when the expert advisor is initialized. It sets the initial settings for the expert advisor using the global variables defined above.

### Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the expert advisor is deinitialized. It can be used to perform any necessary cleanup activities.

### Trading

The `OnTick()` function is called on each tick of the market. It first determines the current market direction using the `GetMarketDirection()` function. Then, it checks if it's a new trading day using the `IsNewTradingDay()` function. If it is, it places a trade based on the market direction using the `Buy()` or `Sell()` functions.

### Custom Functions

The expert advisor includes several custom functions that can be implemented according to the user's unique trading strategy:

- `GetMarketDirection()` - Determines the market direction. It should return `DIRECTION_BUY` for a buy trade and `DIRECTION_SELL` for a sell trade.
- `IsNewTradingDay()` - Checks if it's a new trading day. It should return `true` if it is.
- `SetLotSize()` - Sets the lot size for trading.
- `SetSlippage()` - Sets the slippage value.
- `SetStopLoss()` - Sets the stop loss value.
- `SetTakeProfit()` - Sets the take profit value.
- `Buy()` - Places a buy trade.
- `Sell()` - Places a sell trade.
